# archlinux-haruue - Haruue's Arch Linux Unoffical Repo

## Summary
These are some PKGBUILDs maintained by myself. I build this repo for personal use, because I need install or upgrade customized packages on multi Arch Linux devices. 

## Why not use the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR)?
Well, a repo make it more convenient to upgrade packages by simply `pacman -Syu`. And I think some packages is just too complex to name when I put them in AUR. Or maybe there are same packages in AUR but it is maintained by others, It is not really easy to modify it or make it stay new. 

## So, where is the repo?
Follow the instruction [here](https://cdn.caoyue.com.cn/archlinux-haruue/README.txt).

And whatever you can build the package by simply clone this git repo and [`makepkg`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg) by yourself.

## Can I contribute to this repo?
Sure!

Just fork and make a pull request if you want.
