# archlinux-haruue - Haruue's Arch Linux Unoffical Repo

## Summary
These are some PKGBUILDs maintained by myself. I build this repo for personal use, because I need install or upgrade customized packages on multi Arch Linux devices. 

## Why not use the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR)?
Well, a repo make it more convenient when we upgrade packages by simply `pacman -Syu`. And I think some packages is just too complex to name when I put them in AUR. Or maybe there are same packages in AUR but it is maintained by others, It not really easy to modify it or make it stay new. 

## So, where is the repo?
It is private currently ;-(.

Because the charge of my VPS is a little expensive. Whatever you can build the package by simply clone this git repo and [`makepkg`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg) by yourself. If you are interest in this repo, you can send a email to me.

## Can I contribute for this repo?
Sure!

Just fork and make a pull request if you want.
